# MIT-6.0002-problemsets

I'm going to upload all the code to the problemsets for the course [MIT 6.0002 (Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.htm) offered by MIT OCW here.

I have also created a [Daily Log](https://github.com/krushanbauva/MIT-6.0002-problemsets/issues/1) to keep a track on my progress.
